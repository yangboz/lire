LIRE (Lucene Image Retrieval) is an open source library for content based image retrieval, which means you can search for images that look similar. Besides providing multiple common and state of the art retrieval mechanisms LIRE allows for easy use on multiple platforms. LIRE is actively used for research, teaching and commercial applications. Due to its modular nature it can be used on process level (e.g. index images and search) as well as on image feature level. Developers and researchers can easily extend and modify Lire to adapt it to their needs.

An online demo can be found at http://demo-itec.uni-klu.ac.at/liredemo/

## Downloads ##
Google Code does not provide downloads any more, so I set up a download page at my university, [AAU Klagenfurt](http://www.aau.at).

Downloads are available at: http://www.itec.uni-klu.ac.at/~mlux/lire-release/.

## Getting Started ##
The developer documentation & blog are currently hosted on http://www.semanticmetadata.net/wiki/. In the developer docs common tasks are described, so take a look there if you are starting to use LIRE.

If you are very new to Lire and just want to try out the image search functionality I recommend to start with _LireDemo_, a GUI application which lets you index and search your own photos. If you want to integrate search functions in your software, then take a look at _Lire-SimpleApplication_, which shows you the most straight forward way to use Lire. Both are available in the Downloads section. Small tutorials are available for creating an index and searching images in the at http://www.semanticmetadata.net/wiki/.

We further highly recommend the book titled “Visual Information Retrieval using Java and LIRE”, written by Mathias Lux and Oge Marques. It’s available from Morgan & Claypool, i.e. as PDF eBook (doi:10.2200/S00468ED1V01Y201301ICR025, see [here](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00468ED1V01Y201301ICR025) or on Kindle [here](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Information-Retrieval-using-ebook/dp/B00CDGMPR0/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_kin?ie=UTF8&qid=1366296089&sr=8-1&keywords=java+lux+marques)).

Sometimes you’re stuck with the integration of LIRE in your product, or you don’t excactly know which parameters to choose. In this case (i) we are either happy to help on the mailing list so all LIRE user can benefit, or to (ii) offer our services for implementation, benchmarking and consulting if there is need for private conversation on LIRE. In the latter case please contact Mathias Lux.

## LIRE and Solr ##
If you are searching for the Solr plugin of LIRE ... it's still under construction. Four global features are working fine and its based on Solr 4.10.2. It can be found at https://bitbucket.org/dermotte/liresolr
